# Chessgame

Purpose:
This game enables you to play chess with a friend in the console.

Description:
The game uses unicode to display the characters in the console. PLayers can move the figures 
and then the board is shown again after each move. Player input is given in standard chess notation
e.g. e6 to e5.

Background:
This game was created as part of an excercise for the COMPGC01 Introduction to programming course taken as part of the Msc in Computer Science taken at the University College London. It was created in my second week of coding, so please don't be so hard on me ;D
